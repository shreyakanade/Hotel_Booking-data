This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project focused on understanding and extracting insights from hotel booking order data. The primary objective is to identify trends, patterns, and key factors influencing booking behavior, cancellations, and revenue generation, ultimately aiming to support data-driven decision-making for hotel management and marketing strategies.

Key Features/Analysis Areas:
Booking Trends & Seasonality: Analyzing booking volumes over time (daily, weekly, monthly, yearly) to identify peak seasons, low periods, and emerging trends.
Cancellation Analysis: Investigating cancellation rates, identifying factors contributing to cancellations lead time, deposit type, customer segment and proposing strategies to reduce them.

Customer Segmentation: Grouping customers based on booking patterns, length of stay, origin country, and other relevant features to understand different customer profiles leisure vs. business, repeat vs. new guests.

Revenue & ADR (Average Daily Rate) Analysis: Examining revenue per booking, average daily rates across different room types, market segments, and time periods to optimize pricing strategies.
Lead Time Analysis: Understanding the impact of booking lead time on cancellation rates, ADR, and customer behavior.

Market Segment & Distribution Channel Performance: Evaluating the effectiveness of various market segments (e.g., online travel agencies, direct bookings, corporate) and distribution channels.
Geographical Insights: Mapping customer origins to understand key markets and target marketing efforts.

Special Requests & Preferences: Analyzing common special requests (e.g., parking, room changes) to enhance guest satisfaction.

Predictive Analytics : If applicable, mention any attempts at predicting cancellations or future demand.

Technologies Used:
Programming Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy), R

Data Visualization Libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Tableau, Power BI

Databases: SQL PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite

Jupyter Notebooks: For interactive exploration and documentation of the analysis.

Future Work:
Implement machine learning models to predict booking cancellations.
Develop an interactive dashboard using Dash or Power BI for real-time insights.
Integrate external data sources  local events, competitor pricing for richer analysis.
